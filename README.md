# About
This is the prototype of a platform for a graphic designer. The ssers can sign up and login to view the designer's mockups for their respective proyects.

Because this is a fully working prototype, it emulates real-world storage systems in which the URLs for images are stored in a database and the images themselves are stored in a server. Thus, in order to get this prototype working on you computer you will need to run the queries set forth further below. 

# Getting Started
Run "npm install && npm start" in your react-app directory. Then, navigate to the "server" directory and run "node server.js" in a different terminal window. 

## SQL Queries

# Future features
Add an administrator account that can upload mockups to a user's account.
